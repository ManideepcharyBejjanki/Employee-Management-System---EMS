>How to Install Eclipse on Windows
Step 0: Install JDK

To use Eclipse for Java programming, you need to first install Java Development Kit (JDK). Read "How to Install JDK for Windows".
Step 1: Download

Download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads. Under "Get Eclipse IDE 2029-12" ⇒ Click the link "Download Packages" (instead of pushing the button "Download x86_64"). For beginners, choose the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" and "Windows x86_64" (e.g., "eclipse-java-2020-12-R-win32-x86_64.zip" - about 201MB) ⇒ Download.
Step 2: Unzip

To install Eclipse, simply unzip the downloaded file into a directory of your choice (e.g., "c:\myProject").

I prefer the zip version, because there is no need to run any installer. Moreover, you can simply delete the entire Eclipse directory when it is no longer needed (without running any un-installer). You are free to move or rename the directory. You can install (unzip) multiple copies of Eclipse in the same machine.
